These are small boxes that provide information when a user hovers over a part of a data visualisation such as: a point on a graph, a bar in a bar chart, or a segment in a pie chart. They are used to display additional information about the data point or object, providing more context without cluttering up the chart. In Plotly tooltips are referred to as 'hover_data'.\n",
