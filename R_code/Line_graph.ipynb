So I found a dataset from 2015 which involves experimental statistics that have been used in the Integrated Household Survey.

A facet plot is a type of visualisation that divides data into subplots based on categorical variables. What I'd like to do is create a facet plot of sexuality percentages in England (2010-2014) with individual subplots for our two genders. This is achieved easily in Python due to the plotly.express module, which provides a simple way to create facet plots. Unfortunately, we'll have to go through a bit more of a longwinded route, where we'll manually create our individual plots for each gender, then combine them using the subplot function. Also, plotly.express automatically manages legends to ensure they're unified across facets, but R's plotly requires that we manually sync up these legends. Womp womp. Let's get to it. \n"
